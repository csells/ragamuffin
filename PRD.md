Product Requirements Document

Project codename: Ragamuffin

⸻

1  Purpose and background

Chris wants a portable, developer-friendly way to interrogate personal text files (for example an Obsidian vault) with large-language-model help, while incurring cloud costs only for embedding and inference.  Ragamuffin is a single-file Dart console tool that:
	•	stores embeddings locally in SQLite, so re-embedding happens only on change
	•	lets the LLM perform its own targeted retrieval through an OpenAI function call, avoiding the "embed the whole query" inefficiency of naïve RAG
	•	runs exactly the same on macOS, Windows and Linux, is scriptable, and needs no server or browser UI

The document formalises scope, behaviour and technical contracts for version 0.1.

⸻

2  Goals
	•	Create, update, list and chat against named "vaults" from the command line.
	•	Never re-embed unchanged text; detect drift and warn the user in chat mode.
	•	Expose a single tool (retrieve_chunks) to the LLM so it can pull only the snippets it decides it needs.
	•	Require explicit consent before the first upload of any user content.
	•	Keep every dependency pure Dart (no FFI, no binaries) for the MVP.

Non-goals for 0.1: GUI, web deployment, local-model inference, PDF/epub ingestion, ANN indexing beyond brute-force cosine search.

3  User stories
	1.	As Chris I run
dart run ragamuffin.dart create my-vault ~/Notes --yes
and the tool embeds every markdown chunk in that directory, then returns to the prompt.
	2.	As Chris I later run
dart run ragamuffin.dart chat my-vault,
edit a file during the session, and Ragamuffin warns me the vault is stale.
	3.	As a shell script I can pipe update in a cron job without prompts.
	4.	As Chris I type "list" and see all vault names with their root paths and file inventory.
	5.	As Chris I can delete a vault and all its chunks with delete <name>.

4  Functional specification

Command	Behaviour
create <name> <path> [--yes]	Adds a row to vaults, scans <path> (file or directory).  On first run asks: "⚠️ Files will be uploaded … Proceed?" unless --yes present.  Each text chunk: SHA-256, embed via /v1/embeddings, store vector and text.  Fails if name exists.
update <name>	Looks up root_path.  Adds new chunks, re-embeds changed chunks, deletes vanished chunks, prints delta counts.
chat <name>	Before chatting, recomputes SHA-256 of all disk chunks and compares to hashes in SQLite.  If mismatch prints a yellow warning with the exact update command.  Enters a REPL: each user line is sent to GPT-4o-mini with the retrieve_chunks tool registered.  When the model calls the function, Ragamuffin does an in-process cosine ranking of vectors, returns JSON snippets, then streams the model's final answer.
list [name]	Dumps vaults, their root paths and relative Markdown file list.
delete <name> [--yes]	Deletes the vault and all its chunks from the database. On first run asks: "⚠️ This will permanently delete vault ... Continue?" unless --yes present. Fails if vault doesn't exist.

5  Data model (SQLite)

vaults(id, name UNIQUE, root_path)
chunks(id, vault_id FK, hash, text, vec JSON)

vec is a JSON-encoded List<double> (embedding). hash + vault_id is unique.

⸻

6  External contracts
	•	OpenAI Embeddings: text-embedding-3-small (1536-dim)
	•	OpenAI Chat: gpt-4o-mini with function-calling (tools)
	•	Environment: OPENAI_API_KEY must be supplied via -D or env.

⸻

7  Privacy and security
	•	Warn once per vault that text is sent to OpenAI.
	•	Store only embeddings and plain text locally; no keys in the DB.
	•	User can delete ragamuffin.db to wipe all vectors.

⸻

8  Non-functional requirements
	•	Cold "create" for a 5 MB vault (< 10 k chunks) must finish in under two minutes on a commodity broadband connection.
	•	Memory footprint < 300 MB during cosine search of 10 k vectors.
	•	Code compiled with dart compile exe must run on Linux, macOS, Windows without modification.

⸻

9  Open issues / future
	•	Switchable embedding provider (Gemini compatibility layer).
	•	ANN index (HNSW) to lift chunk count to 100 k+.
	•	PDF chunker with text-position citations.
	•	Optional local LLM via llama_cpp for offline answers.

This PRD captures the first shippable slice of Ragamuffin: a zero-install, script-friendly console RAG tool that keeps embeddings local, lets GPT-4o fetch only what it needs, and warns the user whenever their vault drifts out of sync.
